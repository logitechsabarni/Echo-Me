# EchoMe â€“ Time-Locked Message App

EchoMe is a full-stack web application where users can send messages that unlock at a future date. Built using React (frontend) and Flask (backend), it's like sending a digital letter to your future self. 


## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the App: EchoMe

EchoMe is a time-locked messaging platform that allows users to schedule heartfelt, important, or reflective messages to be delivered in the future. The core idea is to **"echo emotions through time"**â€”whether it's sending yourself a motivational message to unlock on exam day, a birthday wish scheduled for a loved one, or a note of encouragement to unlock during a challenging time. The platform ensures that messages are **only accessible after the specified unlock date**, adding a personal, meaningful touch to every message.

This app addresses emotional well-being, thoughtful communication, and delayed gratification. Itâ€™s ideal for students, friends, and families who want to **leave behind words that matterâ€”just in time, not before.** With a simple, elegant interface and seamless deployment using Flask (backend) and Vite + React (frontend), EchoMe ensures both security and emotional resonance in a digital message.
